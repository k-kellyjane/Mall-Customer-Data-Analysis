# Mall-Customer-Data-Analysis

In this project, I performed customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a mall customer dataset. After following a guided tutorial, I added modifications like the Income-to-Spending Ratio and categorized customers by Age Groups to analyze spending patterns. This project helped me understand how customer groups based on income and spending can inform targeted marketing strategies.
